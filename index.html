    <h2>Welcome to the Resistance</h2>
    <p>You weren’t born to trade in someone else's illusion. You were wired to rebel against it.</p>
    <p><strong>The markets are a machine and most traders are still plugged in.</strong></p>
    <p>Plugged into fake gurus.<br>Plugged into overhyped strategies.<br>Plugged into a fantasy they’ll never escape.</p>
    <p>But not you.</p>
    <p>If you're here, it's because something in you broke free.<br>You stopped chasing signals.<br>You stopped trusting screenshots.<br>You saw through the game.</p>
    <p><strong>Now you're dangerous.</strong></p>

    <h3>We are not a brand. We are not a business. We are a resistance.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We fight hype with truth.</li>
      <li>We trade what’s real.</li>
      <li>We expose the liars.</li>
      <li>And we survive the system that was built to destroy you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Welcome to the other side.<br>Welcome to The Unfunded Resistance.</em></p>

    <h1>Why We're Doing This</h1>
    <p>Everyone’s selling a strategy. We're building something no one talks about: a way to survive. Because the truth is, trading isn’t what you think it is. And if you don’t wake up to that, you’ll keep losing.</p>

    <h2>Because Strategy Isn’t the Answer</h2>
    <p>You’ve been told success comes from the perfect setup. That if you follow the right mentor, it’ll finally click. It won’t.</p>
    <p>Strategy is 10% of success. The rest? Discipline. Emotional control. Patience. Self-awareness.</p>
    <p><em>We’re doing this because someone has to tell you the truth. No filters. No sugarcoating.</em></p>

    <h2>Because the Industry Is Built to Exploit You</h2>
    <p>This isn’t education, it’s a trap. Prop firms, “mentors,” and influencers profit more when you fail.</p>
    <p><em>We’re doing this because someone has to call it what it is — exploitation dressed up as opportunity.</em></p>

    <h2>Because You Have to Rewrite Your Psychology</h2>
    <p>You don’t need another signal. You need a new identity.</p>
    <p><strong>Built to Survive</strong> isn’t a strategy book. It’s a mental survival manual.</p>
    <p><em>We’re doing this because no one else is giving you the tools to fix the real problem, yourself.</em></p>

    <h2>Because Traders Need a Real Community</h2>
    <p>Most groups are cults or echo chambers. Our Discord is raw, honest, and built for accountability.</p>
    <p><em>We’re doing this because traders need support, not hype.</em></p>

    <h2>Because the Gurus Aren’t Gods</h2>
    <p>The Guruometer exposes the frauds. No filters. No partnerships. Just truth.</p>
    <p><em>We’re doing this because transparency is the weapon they fear most.</em></p>

    <h2>This is The Unfunded Resistance</h2>
    <p>We’re not here to hold your hand. We’re here to wake you up. If you're ready to think for yourself and stop bleeding, welcome.</p>
    <p><strong>You’ve found the right war.</strong></p>
