    <h1></h1>

    <p>This isn’t another “how to trade” book.</p>

    <p><strong>Built to Survive</strong> was written for the traders who’ve been chewed up and spat out by the markets, not because they were weak but because the entire system is designed to break them.</p>

    <p>If you’ve ever stared at your screen knowing exactly what not to do... and did it anyway, this book is for you.</p>

    <p>Inside, you'll find the raw, unfiltered truth about what it takes to endure in trading:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How to build a battle-tested trading routine that protects you from yourself</li>
      <li>Why most traders fail (and how not to be one of them)</li>
      <li>The real reason “discipline” isn’t enough</li>
      <li>The mindset, tactics, and habits that make survival possible</li>
      <li>How to log your trades like a soldier writes a field report</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is about more than charts and setups.  
      It’s about turning yourself into someone who can still stand after the losses, the doubts, and the weeks when nothing works.
